Battery Management System for electrical vehicle

I would like to tell you a little about my experience in engineering and creating solutions; I participated in 
the electric vehicle project, which is one of the largest projects of my university and I have done various 
studies on electric vehicles, which are the technology of the future. I have done studies related to the 
battery management system (BMS), I have put forward a BMS product that controls 20 series 20 cell 
batteries and provides balanced charging using an STM microcontroller. Therefore I am interested in 
battery technologies and microcontroller technologies.
